 
1)- LIST

--> It is an ordered collection of items 
--> We can store anything in lists be it of int, float , string datatype
--> Ex. number=[1,2,3,4] 
--> Lists are mutable i.e any changes made will change the original lists
--> Slicing is present

2)- DICTIONARY

--> It is an unordered collections of data
--> It is denoted as key:value pair
--> We use dictionaries becausse of the limitations of lists, lists are not
	enough to represent real data
--> Ex. person={'name':'DEEPANSHU' , 'fav':12}

3)- TUPLE

--> We can store anything in tuples be it of int, float , string datatype
--> Tuples are immutable, once created cannot be updated
--> We use tuples when we know that data will not be changed
--> It is faster than lists
--> Ex. number=(1,2,3,4,5)

4)- SETS

--> It is an unordered collection of unique items
--> It is basically used to remove redundancy
--> It does not have key:value pair
--> Ex. n={1,2,3,2}

5)- STRING

--> It is a collection of characters
--> Many operations are performed on strings
--> They are immutable
-->	Ex. name="Asuma"
